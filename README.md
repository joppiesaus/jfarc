This is a program that is made to archive websites without cloning all resources.

It's not finished, and I don't know about the quality of it, but for me, it works. I made this for my own website, but this is pretty stupid since I use git as version control so I can always check out how it was at a certain date/commit.

# Building
`nim c -d:release arc.nim`

# Using
TODO :)
